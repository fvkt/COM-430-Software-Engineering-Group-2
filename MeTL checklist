MeTL DevOps Checklist (1-Week Sprint)
Project: Pet Rock Genie
Team: Carlos Silva · Cody Bradley · Joseph Prignano
Course: COM-430 – Software Engineering

Phase 1 – Modeling & Planning
 Define environments and promotion path:

Dev → Test (v2.0.0) → Final (v2.1.0-Final).

 Document objectives:

Maintain yes/no/maybe behavior from Version 1.

Improve logging, input handling, and code organization.

 Capture versioning rules:

Semantic style: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 2.1.0).

 Define acceptance criteria:

No uncaught exceptions in normal use.

Logs contain app start/end, questions, answers, errors, interrupts.

Phase 2 – Test Environment Setup
 Add environment metadata in code:

ENVIRONMENT = "TEST" and VERSION = "2.0.0" for Test Stage.

 Ensure banner shows environment and version on startup.

 Configure logging:

Log file: pet_rock_genie_v2.log.

Format: timestamp, level, message.

 Update README with “How to Run (Test Stage)” section.

Phase 3 – Implementation & Promotion
 Implement or refine:

Input trimming and empty-input handling.

Question mark suggestion for non-? inputs.

Exit commands: quit, exit, bye.

 Verify logging coverage:

Log each question, answer, and any errors.

 Tag code:

v2.0.0-test for Test Stage.

v2.1.0-final for Final Version.

Phase 4 – Testing & Evaluation
 Create basic test cases:

Normal question with ?.

Question without ? (tip expected).

Empty input (prompt again).

Exit command (graceful shutdown).

 Run scripted test harness (see below) to generate test_snapshot.json.

 Review pet_rock_genie_v2.log:

Confirm all expected log lines exist.

 Decide promotion:

If tests pass and logs are clean → promote to Final.

Phase 5 – Logging & Monitoring
 Standardize log content:

Include question number and text in logs.

 Check log usability:

Can an instructor follow what happened from the log alone?

 Document log behavior briefly in README or LOGGING.md.

Phase 6 – Final Deployment & Handoff
 Switch config to:

ENVIRONMENT = "FINAL" and VERSION = "2.1.0-Final".

 Update banner to “FINAL VERSION – Pet Rock Genie 2.1.0”.

 Prepare submission package:

Source code, README, MeTL checklist, runbook, example log, and test_snapshot.json.

 Note rollback:

Revert to v2.0.0-test tag if you need to demonstrate Test Stage behavior.
